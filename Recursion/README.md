## basic-recursion

Using **recursion**, write a function called **sumBetween** that takes two numbers (_start_ and _end_) as parameters and returns the sum of the numbers from start to end. What happens if the start is larger than the end? Make sure the function takes care of this case.

```javascript

sumBetween(2, 7); // ==> 27
sumBetween(2, 5); // ==> 14
sumBetween(5, 2); // ==> 14
```
Using **recursion**, write a function called **joinRecursion** that takes array of strings and join them in one string
representing how many times the string str should be repeated.

```javascript
joinRecursion(["don't "," use "," loops. " ]); // => "don't use loops. "

```

### CHOOSE ONE


#### OPTION 1

- [ ] Complete the function `getStringValues` and `sumNumericValues`.
- [ ] They take a single argument, an object containing nested objects of any depth.
- [ ] getStringValues: It returns all of the values of the objects that are strings.
- [ ] sumNumericValues: It returns the sum of all the numeric values.
- [ ] Your function will only be tested with objects that have strings, numbers, or other objects as properties.

```javascript
var exampleNestedObject = {
  name: "Tolstoy",
  age: 99,
  home: {
    roommates: 2,
    address: {
      street: {
        street1: "discombobulated",
        street2: null,
      },
      number: 13,
      city: "stilton",
      zip: 94618,
    },
  },
};

getStringValues(exampleNestedObject); // returns [ "Tolstoy", "discombobulated", "stilton" ]

sumNumericValues(exampleNestedObject); // returns 94732
```

#### OPTION 2

* [ ] flatten nested arrays.
  * Your solution should always return a flatten copy of the input array, regardless of how many nested levels are in the input array.
  * You must use recursion to solve this.

```javascript
flatten([1, [[2, 3, [4], 5], 6, [7, [8]], 9], 10]); // returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```
